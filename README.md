Coding Standards
=============
This repo holds the code for the Coding Standards.

* C#
* C++

Coding standards define a programming style. A coding standard does not usually concern itself with wrong or right in a more abstract sense. It is simply a set of rules and guidelines for the formatting of source code.

Common Aspects of a Coding Standard:

* Naming Conventions
* File Naming and Organization
* Formatting and Indentation
* Comments and Documentation
* Classes, Functions and Interfaces
* Testing

Sometimes a coding standard is an accepted practice for a particular language. For instance, programmers generally accept that when writing C# source code they will write parameters and private and protected fields using Camel casing. They will write all other identifiers using Pascal casing. What this means for the C# programmer is that they can look at a piece of C# source code written by another and quickly indentify segments. This increases readability substantially.

The other common type of coding standard is the one used in or between development teams. Consider that professional code does not simply perform a job. Professional code performs a job in such a way that it is easy to maintain and debug.

In professional environments, the benefits of coding standards are readability, maintainability and compatibility. Any member of a development should be able to read the code of another member. The coder who maintains a piece of code tomorrow may not be the coder who programmed it today. In addition, today’s enterprise solutions are so complex that multiple development teams unite to build a singular enterprise software application. With coding standards, distinct teams can rely o­n the way that they can interface with the code built by a separate team.

Benefits:

* Code Integration
* Team Member Integration
* Maintenance
* Uniform Problem Solving
* Minimizes Communication
* Minimizes Performance Pitfalls
* Saves Money Due to Less Man Hours
