Intro To Unity
=============
This repo holds the source code for the "Intro To Unity" online course.

The course instructor Samuel Asher Rivello  asks that students have the latest public version of Unity installed before the first day of the course. It is freely available for Mac and Windows at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download. The "Hub" option is recommended but not required. 

The format of each class will include a few short breaks and regular opportunities for students to complete mini-exercises on their own computers using Unity and to ask questions. A mobile phone is optional. We may use it to test our projects. 

Please bring a PC or MAC computer, a webcam, microphone, headphones, stable internet, and quiet place. The use of headphones prevents echo and greatly improve the quality of the experience for all students. To test your internet speed you can use https://fast.com/. Stable download speed above 10Mbps is recommended. 

There will be no homework.
